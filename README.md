# Benchmark App for PC Specifications

The goal of this project is to design, implement and test a benchmark for PC performance parameters, such as the type of the processor, the frequency, the memory size, the transfer speed of a block of data and the execution speed of some arithmetical and logical operations. 
	The program should be used by anyone who wants to test the performance of his/hers PC, on any PC.
The program code will be written in Visual Studio IDE by Microsoft using C++ and the graphical interface of the application will be written IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains using Java and the Spring Framework. It should be very well organized in packages and classes. The results of the benchmarking will be stored in files in order to be displayed afterwards on the GUI.

•	The application should allow users to choose which test to do and display the results of the chosen test
•	The application should display the type of the processor
•	The application should display the frequency of the processor
•	The application should display the memory size
•	The application should test the transfer speed of a block of data, allocating and deallocating memory
•	The application should test the execution speed of an encryption algorithm
•	The application should test the multicore by a multithread algorithm
