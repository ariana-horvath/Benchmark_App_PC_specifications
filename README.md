# Benchmark App for PC Specifications

The goal of this project is to design, implement and test a benchmark for PC performance parameters, such as the type of the processor, the frequency, the memory size, the transfer speed of a block of data and the execution speed of some arithmetical and logical operations. <br /><br />
The program should be used by anyone who wants to test the performance of his/hers PC, on any PC.<br /><br />
The program code (tests) will be written in C++ and the graphical interface of the application will be written in Java using the Spring Framework. <br /><br />

The application should:
- allow users to choose which test to do and display the results of the chosen test
- display the type of the processor
- display the frequency of the processor
- display the memory size
- test the transfer speed of a block of data, allocating and deallocating memory
- test the execution speed of an encryption algorithm
- test the multicore by a multithread algorithm
